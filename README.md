This repository contains material for the Python for Neuroscience course. The materials include classes, some assignments and other useful information. As a student of the course, you should star and watch it (top-right corner) to receive notifications when I update it with new material.

Homework assignments, excluding the first one, will be presented in different repositories, but the lectures themselves reside here. They're named `classX.ipynb` and are viewable in GitHub, and editable and runnable with Jupyter Notebook. I've also uploaded them in a presentation-like `.html` format.

If you come across any useful learning resources which are not listed in `Resources.md`, please don't hesitate to create a pull request with the new resource you found.

General questions - both technical and Python-related - can be posted to the "Issues" tab on the top of this screen. I'll do my best to answer them as soon as possible.

All classes that are held online are being held in [this Zoom link](https://zoom.us/j/780376669).
