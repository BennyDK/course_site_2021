This repository contains material for the Python for Neuroscience course. The materials include classes, some assignments and other useful information. As a student of the course, you should star and watch it (top-right corner) to receive notifications when I update it with new material.

Homework assignments, excluding the first one, will be presented in different repositories, but the lectures themselves reside here. They're named `classX.ipynb` and are viewable in GitHub, and editable and runnable with Jupyter Notebook. I've also uploaded them in a presentation-like `.html` format.

If you come across any useful learning resources which are not listed in `Resources.md`, please don't hesitate to create a pull request with the new resource you found.

General questions - both technical and Python-related - can be posted to the "Issues" tab on the top of this screen. I'll do my best to answer them as soon as possible.

## Homework Assignments:

* Assignment 1 - The full solution and grades can be found in `assignments/assignments1`.
* Assignment 2 - Click [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/LtzsOIun) to receive a link to the assignment. Deadline: 30.3.20, 15:00.

## Hackathon

The course's final project will be completed during a hackathon orchestrated by the Sagol school. A list of projects will be created later on this semester, and each student will assign him or herself to a project. Dates for the hackathon will be announced during the semster.
